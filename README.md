Analysis of methylation data as applied to the CXXC5 gene in breast cancer.

## Getting Started

 - [install Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)
 - ensure all data is in `data` directory of this repo (this directory will be gitignored so these immense files cannot be accidentally added to the repo since their size makes github unhappy)
 - data can be downloaded from [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/12GMXk27t2iwBZWnKJxrNbw6bfewHdhTW) (request access from josephacasano@gmail.com)
 - run `jupyter notebook`


## Gitignore

The gitignore file is located in the root of this repo but hidden (`.gitignore`). We're git-ignoring the data directory.
